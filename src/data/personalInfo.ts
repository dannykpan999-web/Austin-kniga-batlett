      "I'm a Senior Full-Stack Software Developer with strong experience building scalable, high-performance web and mobile applications. I work across frontend and backend systems, focusing on clean architecture, performance, and long-term maintainability.",
      "On the frontend, I design modular and scalable UI architectures using modern frameworks and TypeScript. I have led large refactors, built reusable component systems, improved rendering performance, reduced bundle size, and implemented WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards.",
      "On the backend, I design REST APIs, implement business logic, and work with relational databases such as PostgreSQL and MySQL. I collaborate closely with backend teams on API contracts, data modeling, and performance optimization. I have experience working with Node.js and Python-based services in production environments.",
      "I follow best practices in testing, code quality, CI/CD, and scalable system design. I am comfortable working in cross-functional teams and taking ownership from architecture design to deployment and monitoring."
